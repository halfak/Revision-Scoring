# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.11.12]
* Switch yamlconf to wmf maintained fork.
  
## [2.11.11]
* Bump tabulate and numpy versions.
* Update (temporarily) yamlconf's version to a git commit
  while we wait for https://github.com/halfak/yamlconf/pull/8

## [2.11.10]
* Bump numpy version to 1.24 and fix failing test (numpy.float has been deprecated)
* Loosen upper bound restriction for scipy

## [2.11.9]
* Add github actions for CI with debian bullseye image
* Updated dictionaries that have a hunspell package in debian. hunspell is a "superset" of myspell. 

## [2.11.8]
* Add new github action that pushes to PYPI - no code relevant changes

## [2.11.6]

* Allow mwapi up to 0.6.x in requirements.txt
* Fixed unit tests for Hindi Wikipedia.

## [2.11.5]

* Add MWApiCache to the API extractor to bypass the default mwapi usage.
  Useful when revscoring is used in frameworks (like KServe) where
  asyncio/tornado and co-routines are neeed.
* Allow numpy versions 1.19.x.

## [2.11.4]

* No-op release, the artifact uploaded for 2.11.3 may not be the correct
  one, hence a new release to avoid issues. The wheel was compiled with
  Python 3.9 that should work just fine, but since the project support
  only Python 3.7 we want to be extra careful. The new wheel has been
  created from a Python 3.7 venv.

## [2.11.3]

* No-op release, the artifact uploaded for 2.11.2 may not be the correct
  one, hence a new release to avoid issues (first time publishing
  a revscoring artifact for a new uploader).
